<!-- Lesson: Use data properties when you want to bind a static property in 
      template. Use computed properties when you want to bind a property in 
      template determined at runtime. Use a watcher when you want to do some behind
      the scenes calculations that have nothing to do with binding values to the 
      template that Vue uses, but have everything to do with modifying a property. 
      Note that setTimeout in a watcher is triggered anytime a property is changed.
