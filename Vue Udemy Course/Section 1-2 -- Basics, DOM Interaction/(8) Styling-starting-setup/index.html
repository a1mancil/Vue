<!-- Lessons: Dynamic Inline Style vs Dynamic Class Style. How to select and deselect a div. Dynamically declared vs statically
          declared classes. Using computed properties to declare classes. Using
          array of classes i.e. :class="['demo', {active: boxBSelected}]" 
          Change the style of page with Vue at runtime
          Up to this point I have learned about data binding and event binding
          (interpolation), Vue reactivity with compute properties and watchers.
          Now it's time for styling.

      <!-- Dynamic Line Style Notes -->
      <!-- Can listen to clicks on any html element. Remember that ":" means v-bind.
          Regular html style tag:    style="boarder-color: red;"
          Vue style tag:            :style="{borderColor: 'red'}" 
          
          Note that #ccc is a grey color. The ternary below is saying that if the
          box that was selected was box A, then the boarder of the box will be color
          red, else just keep it grey i.e. #ccc

          Problem with this way of declaring style, inline style:
            :style="{borderColor: boxASelected ? 'red' : '#ccc'}" 
          Is that it will overule all other styles

          If box A is selected then bind the two css classes demo & ative
          to the div, else only bind one class -- demo

          Draw back to using :class="boxASelected ? 'demo active' : 'demo'" is that
          it is very hard to read.

          A better way to change the style dynamically is:
            :class="{demo: true, active: boxASelected}" 
          Since it's more readable

          The better way to change style dynamically is via:
            class="demo"
            :class="{active: boxASelected}" 
          This is because the first class attribute refers to the styles that are 
          statically declared. The class attribute with the colin reference ":"
          refers to styles which are dynamically declared at runtime. Here there is
          a separation of css classes which are statically and dynamically declared. 
          
          We can finally store the dynamically types class in a computed property
          as seen below
        -->
      <div
            class="demo"
            :class="boxAClasses" 
            @click="boxSelected('A')">
      </div>
      <!-- You can also delcare an array of classes that a div would include -->
      <div 
            :class="['demo', boxBClasses]" 
            @click="boxSelected('B')">
      </div>
      <div 
            class="demo"
            :class="boxCClasses" 
            @click="boxSelected('C')">
      </div>    </section>
  </body>
</html>
