<!-- Lessons: Event Modifiers. Event Listener vs Event Handler. Event Handler Arguments. 
     Event Payload argument "event" (Special first argument in method that handles
     event i.e. the event handler). Event Listener in Vue e.g. "v-on:click" listens
     to event then triggers Event Handler in Vue e.g. add(10) i.e. all the code 
     after event has been triggered. Learned how the code is more dynamic by not 
     hard coding values & instead overrriding Event Arguments.
     Dont want to put logic in html code. -->

       <!-- A the special "event" argument which contains the PointerEventÂ Obj 
            would have been passed if the add method would have not passed 10 
            as the argument. -->
      <button v-on:click="add(10)">Add 10</button> 
      <!-- Can also write "@" instead of "v-on" -->
      <!-- Modifier that specifies when the event occurs. Will reduce on right click
           can also have following modifiers: .left (default), .middle  -->
      <button @click.right="reduce(10)">Reduce 10 on right click only</button>
      
      <!-- v-once allows to fix the initial value of any data field -->
      <p v-once>Starting Counter: {{ counter }}</p>
      <p>Result: {{ counter }}</p>
      <!-- Vue can detect that "setSomeText" is a method -->
      <!-- Input html tag vs input event attribute:
          When the input event attribute (to the right of ":") fires (i.e. is
          triggered by someone typing) the event payload is passed as the first 
          argument of the method specified to handle the event. In this case 
          "setSomeText" is passed an "InputEvent Obj" argument by default and 
          it is up to the developer to either use it, or override the argument. 
          In our case, we will use the InputEvent Obj in our js to access the 
          entire value the user has entered via 
          "[InputEvent Obj Argument].target.value" -->
      <input type="text" v-on:input="setSomeText"> 
      <p>Type something: {{ someText }}</p>

      <!-- If we desire to use the event payload and add more desired arguments e.g.
           a last name, we must use the word "event" along with the "$" identifier 
           i.e. "$event", and set that as the first argument of the method.   -->
           <!-- Can also have more than one event listener & handler, keyup is when
                any key is pressed and released, then with modifier enter, only will
                execute when enter key is pressed  -->
      <input 
        type="text" 
        v-on:input="setFullName($event, ' Mancilla Valdez')" 
        v-on:keyup.enter="confirmInput"
      /> 
      <!-- Confirmed name should only be displayed when user hits the enter key -->
      <p>Your Name: {{ confirmedName }}</p>


      <!-- When we hit the button it will send an http request to the server serving 
      this app. We have no server in our case because we are running it locally, but 
      the browser still sends a request to our local machine. When you're using Vue, 
      you want to prevent the browser default of sending an http request to our 
      local server and handle it manually, read & validate in the Vue app using js, 
      then send it manually to backend server (e.g. store in database). Goal is to 
      prevent browser default of automatically sending http request to backend server
      because we usally want to parse the data. Vue app will restart when button is
      hit. -->
      <!-- Below is the event modifier "prevent". This event modifier changes the 
           browser behavior  -->
      <form v-on:submit.prevent="submitForm">
        <input type="text">
        <button>Sign Up</button>
      </form>
